    %p SafeWTF's syntax is very simple. First, decide which URLs you would like to test. Then, add each URL with at least one test:
    %pre="On http://example.com\n  I should see Welcome to example.com"
    %p You can add as many URLs as you like, and as many tests as you like under each URL. Valid tests are:
    %dl
      %dt I should see, I should not see
      %dd Looks for text in the rendered page

      %dt Source should contain, source should not contain
      %dd Looks for a string the source code of the page

      %dt Headers should contain, headers should not contain
      %dd Looks for a particular named header
        
    %h3 I should see
    %p This check retreives a page and looks for text without looking at HTML tags. So, the following check:
    %pre="  I should see Hello, world!"
    %p Would match all of:
    %pre="Hello, world!"
    %pre="<strong>Hello</strong> world!"
    %pre="Hello,<br>world!"

    %h3 Source should contain
    %p This check retreives a page and looks for text in its source code. So, the following check:
    %pre="  I should see <strong>Hello</strong>, world!"
    %p Would match:
    %pre="Hello is bold: <strong>Hello</strong> world! Bold text is great!"
    
    %h3 Headers should conttain
    %p This check retrieves the headers of a page and looks for a header with the name you specify. So, the following check:
    %pre="  Headers should contain: X-Varnish"
    %p Would match if there was a header like:
    %pre="X-Varnish: 128371292"
    %p But would not match:
    %pre="X-Varnish-Check: miss"

    %h3 General tips
    %ul
      %li SafeWTF is case sensitive! So make sure your lines are capitalised.
