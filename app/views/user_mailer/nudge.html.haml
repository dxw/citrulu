  %p{:style => content_p_styles} Thanks again for signing up to Citrulu!
  %p{:style => content_p_styles} You activated your account over a week ago so we thought we'd get in touch to see how you're getting on.
  %p{:style => content_p_styles} If you've already set up some tests for your live websites, then we're running them on a regular basis: we'd love to know if they've helped you uncover any problems and generally what you think of the service.

  %p{:style => content_p_styles} If you haven't got that far yet, we've set up some Tutorial test files to guide you through the process of writing tests for your sites:
  %table{:style => "text-align: center; margin-bottom:10px;"} 
    %tr
      %td{:style => "width:220px"}
      %td{:style => content_button_td_styles + "width:198px;"} 
        =link_to "Let's get started!", @first_tutorial_url, :style => content_button_a_styles
      %td{:style => "width:220px"}
  
  %p{:style => content_p_styles} Citrulu is free during the Alpha, so please feel free to add as many tests as you like.
  %p{:style => content_p_styles} 
    Hopefully you should find all the help you need, but if you get stuck, don't hesitate to
    = mail_to 'contact@citrulu.com', "send us an email", :style => content_a_styles
    &ndash; or post something using the feedback form on the site.
