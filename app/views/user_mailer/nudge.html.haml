  %p{:style => content_p_styles} Thanks again for signing up to Citrulu!
  %p{:style => content_p_styles} It looks like you haven't written any tests for your sites yet so we thought we'd get in touch to see if we can help you get started.
  %p{:style => content_p_styles} Citrulu is a service that lets you write tests for your live websites which we will then run on a regular basis so that you can be confident that everything is working as it should be.
  
  %p{:style => content_p_styles} We've made writing tests for your sites super-easy: we've created an example test file which you can quickly modify to point at the sites you want to test:
  %table{:style => "text-align: center; margin-bottom:10px;"} 
    %tr
      %td{:style => "width:220px"}
      %td{:style => content_button_td_styles + "width:198px;"} 
        =link_to "Let's get started!", test_files_url, :style => content_button_a_styles
      %td{:style => "width:220px"}
  
  %p{:style => content_p_styles} Citrulu is free during the Alpha, so please feel free to add as many tests as you like.
  %p{:style => content_p_styles} 
    Hopefully you should find all the help you need, but if you get stuck, don't hesitate to
    = mail_to 'contact@citrulu.com', "send us an email", :style => content_a_styles
    &ndash; or post something using the feedback form on the site. 
  
  %p{:style => content_p_styles} We'd also love to hear from you if you've got any suggestions for how we can make Citrulu even better.
