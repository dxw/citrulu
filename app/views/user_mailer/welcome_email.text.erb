Citrulu is free during the Alpha, so please feel free to add as many tests as you like.

Hopefully you should find all the help you need, but if you get stuck, don't hesitate to 
send us an email <contact@citrulu.com> â€“ or post something using the feedback form on the site. 

We'd also love to hear from you if you've got any suggestions for how we can make Citrulu even better.
