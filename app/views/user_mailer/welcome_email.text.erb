Thanks for joining Citrulu!

We're delighted that you've signed up to test your live websites. We've created some tutorials to make it really easy for you to get started with some simple but powerful tests.

Let's get started: <%=raw url_for @first_tutorial_url %>

Citrulu is currently in Beta and it's free at the moment, so please feel free to add as many tests as you like.

Hopefully you should find all the help you need, but if you get stuck, don't hesitate to 
send us an email <contact@citrulu.com> â€“ or post something using the feedback form on the site. 

We'd also love to hear from you if you've got any suggestions for how we can make Citrulu even better.
