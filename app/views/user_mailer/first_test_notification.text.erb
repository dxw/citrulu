We just ran your tests for the first time and good news: they all pass!

We just ran your tests for the first time. Unfortunately there were a few failures. That might mean that there's something wrong with your site, but at this stage it's more likely that your tests aren't checking for the right things.

You can try and make your tests pass by editing your test files: <%=raw url_for test_files_url %>

If you have any difficulties, please get in touch <contact@citrulu.com>.
