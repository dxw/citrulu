Your weekly summary for the week ending <%= @date %>:
---------------

<% if @number_of_running_test_files == 0 %>
You don't currently have any test files set to run, so we're not keeping an eye on your sites.
Go to your test files page to write a test file, or set some to run: <%=raw url_for test_files_url %>
Please get in touch with us if there's anything we can do to help: <contact@citrulu.com>
<% else %> 
You currently have <%= pluralize(@number_of_running_test_files, 'test file') %> set to run, <%= @number_of_domains == 0 ? "but no domains are actually being tested!" : "covering #{ pluralize(@number_of_domains, 'domain') }."%>   
<% end %>    

<% if @number_of_test_runs == 0 %> 
  <% if @number_of_running_test_files > 0 %>
Citrulu hasn't run any of your test files yet. This might be because you've only recently set them to run. If nothing gets run in the next hour or so, please get in touch with us and we'll look into it: <contact@citrulu.com>.

The pages that had problems this week were:

Over the past week we tested the following domains:

The pages with the slowest average response times for the week are:
  <% @slowest_page_response_times.each do |url, response_time| %>
- <%= "#{ response_time.round }ms: #{url}" %>
