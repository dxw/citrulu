Thanks again for signing up to Citrulu!

It looks like you haven't written any tests for your sites yet so we thought we'd get in touch to see if we can help you get started.

Citrulu is a service that lets you write tests for your live websites which we will then run on a regular basis so that you can be confident that everything is working as it should be.

We've made writing tests for your sites super-easy: we've created an example test file which you can quickly modify to point at the sites you want to test. <%=raw url_for test_files_url %>

Citrulu is free during the Alpha, so please feel free to add as many tests as you like.

Hopefully you should find all the help you need, but if you get stuck, don't hesitate to 
send us an email <contact@citrulu.com> â€“ or post something using the feedback form on the site. 

We'd also love to hear from you if you've got any suggestions for how we can make Citrulu even better.
