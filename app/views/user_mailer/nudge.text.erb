Thanks again for signing up to Citrulu!

You activated your account over a week ago so we thought we'd get in touch to see how you're getting on.

If you've already set up some tests for your live websites, then we're running them on a regular basis: we'd love to know if they've helped you uncover any problems and generally what you think of the service.

If you haven't got that far yet, we've set up some Tutorial test files to guide you through the process of writing tests for your sites: <%=raw url_for @first_tutorial_url %>

Citrulu is free during the Beta, so please feel free to add as many tests as you like.

Hopefully you should find all the help you need, but if you get stuck, don't hesitate to 
send us an email <contact@citrulu.com> â€“ or post something using the feedback form on the site. 

We'd also love to hear from you if you've got any suggestions for how we can make Citrulu even better.
